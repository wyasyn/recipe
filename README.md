## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I Learned

Working on this project helped me improve my understanding of structuring semantic HTML and optimizing SEO metadata. I also enhanced my styling skills using TailwindCSS.

Here is an example of using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for better semantics:

```html
<figure>
  <img src="/images/image-omelette.jpeg" alt="A freshly cooked omelette" />
  <figcaption>A simple and delicious omelette</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Using TailwindCSS utility classes for styling:

```css
.bg-rose-50 {
  background-color: #fff1f2;
}
```

### Continued Development

Going forward, I want to:

- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA attributes where necessary.
- Optimize image loading using Next.js' `next/image` component.
- Enhance performance by minimizing CSS and JavaScript bundle sizes.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Great reference for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript best practices.
- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Helped in structuring responsive styles efficiently.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Provided real-world project challenges to improve skills.
